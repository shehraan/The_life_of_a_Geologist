  <h2>Job opportunities for a geologist in America, Canada, and Ontario</h2>
  <ol type='1'>
    <li>In America, 77.80% of geologists are male while 22.20% are female. The share of male geologists has increased by
      2% from 2010. Additionally, in 2010, about 83% of geologists were white, while 6% were asian, another 6% were
      Hispanic or Latino and 3% were Black or African American. Through recent data, it is evident that this trend did
      not chnage and the numbers have stayed [nearly] the same. The geologist unemployment rate has also decreased over
      time, from 2.4% in 2010 to 1.4% most recently. We can also see in the graph below the pay distribution for
      geologists in 2021 (note that
      these
      amounts are in USD and not CAD)

      <br>
      The average salary in this field has increased by 24% since 2005 and is expected to continue to grow at a rate of
      7% in the decade between 2020 and 2030. You cse the slider below to see the average salary for each year
      between 2005 and 2021.
    </li>
    <input type="range" min="2005" max="2021" id="numberSlider" value="2005"
      oninput="sliderValue.innerHTML = 'Year: ' + value;getId('outputParagraph').innerHTML='The salary is: $'+ yearToSalary(getId('numberSlider').value)" />
    <p id="sliderValue">Year: 2005</p>
    <p id="outputParagraph">The salary is: $86382</p>
    <li>In Canada, geology is an uncommon career path, it is a tough job to find data for. Instead of
      a geologist in particular, a more common career that is closely related within the geologist field, is an
      environmental scientist. The difference between the two is that an environmental geologist
      specializes
      in discovering the structure, composition, and processes of our planet in order to find natural resources and find
      ways to prevent environmental damage caused by humans. Meanwhile, geology is much broader and also includes other
      careers in geology such as
      geological engineering. Nation-wide, the job outlook of an environmental geologist is fair across the board.
      However, exceptions are made for 2
      provinces: Saskatchewan and Alberta.
      In Saskatchewan, the job outlook fairs very well and it would be the best province for a geologist to find work
      in. Meanwhile, Alberta has the poorest job outlook for a geologist and should not be in consideration when
      choosing a province to move to, for your job.</li>
    <li>In Ontario, environmental geologists earn a median income of $47.60 per hour. The income range is between $31.25
      and $62.50. The job outlook is good for geologists in Ontario in the next two years as there is employment growth
      which will bring many new professions. This will help compensate for the recently unemployed workers who
      previously worked in this job.</li>

  <h2>Learning opportunities</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>Augmented reality is a technology that is enabling new experiential learning opprtunities in the field of
      geology. Through augmented reality, students can use constructs and sandboxes to effectively train themselves in
      the field. These sandboxes and constructs would allow for a realistic simulation of earth's processes which would
      provide for a neat demonstration and can be included in tutorials that provide experiential learning.</p>
    <p>Another option for students that want to gain experiential learning in geology, is an internship. Internships
      will allow these students to test out their career path, such as by collecting substances, testing soil samples,
      and analyzing the data. Internships are also advantageous in that they allow students to earn money alongside
      doing the experiential learning.
    </p>
    <p>A student can also attend virtual workshops, such as the ones offered by Mining Matters. A workshop like this,
      can allow students to have an attempt at developing their reasoning and critical thinking skills while also
      reinforcing any prior knowledge.</p>
  </ul>
  <h2>Post-secondary programs for a geologist</h2>
  <p>While there are many post-secondary programs in geology, the main ones that I will be taking a look at, is the
    environmental geoscience program offered by the <em>Trent University</em>, the <em>University of Toronto</em>, and
    the <em>University of Manitoba</em> </p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Trent Unviversity</li>
    <p>For admissions, the <em>Trenth University</em> requires an six grade 12 4U or 4M courses, including MHF4U or
      MCV4U, SCH4U and the ENG4U course with at least a mark of 60%. In addition, applicants must also have an Ontario
      Secondary School Diploma, as well as a 75% average mark. The program is heavily based on experiential learning
      through hands-on lab exercises and work placements. This program can set you on a strong path for your career and
      give you the experience needed to advance as a worker. However, the tuition fees for this University are hidden
      and can only be discovered by speaking directly to their support.</p>
    <li>Unviversity of Toronto</li>
    <p>The <em>University of Toronto</em> is a very prestigious university and hence is much tougher to get into than
      the programs offered at other schools. Theey also require applications to have taken grade 12 English, advanced
      functions, biology, and chemistry. A competitive average mark for getting admitted here would be in the Mid to
      high 70s. In addition, the tuition also starts at $6,210 for local students.</p>
    <li>Brock University</li>

    <em>Brock University</em> requires ENG4U, MHF4U, as well as SBI4U, SPH4U, SES4U and SCH4U courses. The cutoff for
    this program at <em>Brock University</em> is in the mid 70s.However, the tuition at Brock's University is extremely
    expensive, at $15,000 per semester.
